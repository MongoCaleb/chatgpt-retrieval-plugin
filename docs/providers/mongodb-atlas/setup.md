# MongoDB Atlas

[MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas) is a suite of database and 
data services to simplify building data-focused applications. 
[Atlas Vector Search](https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-vector-search) 
puts your data and search indexes together in one place, greatly improving efficiency
and consistency, and simplifies your overall data architecture. And because Atlas 
supports multiple cloud providers, you have full control over your storage options. 
Setup is very simple: **you only need your OpenAPI API Key to set up your app**. 
No other environment variables are needed.
